Current version supports updating tags in existing OSM data from external csv file.

In other words: for each element in CSV (recognized by id and type) downloaded original data from the server, and then tag values from csv copied into.

All element tags which were not in CSV - untouched. If CSV have empty value for some tag - this tag is removed. If CSV have updated value - it will replace old value. If CSV have not existing tag - it will be added.
All columns which starts from "@" are ignored.
Special parameters used to pass names of the "id" and "type" columns. (type recognized as in osmconvert 0-node, 1-way, 2-relation)
Another special column "update" may be used, to process only marked rows in CSV. Column may have any non empty value.
