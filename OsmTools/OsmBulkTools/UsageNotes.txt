Current version supports two modes: 

1 updating tags in existing OSM data from external csv file.

	In other words: for each element in CSV (recognized by id and type) downloaded original data from the server, and then tag values from csv copied into.

	All element tags which were not in CSV - untouched. If CSV have empty value for some tag - this tag is removed. If CSV have updated value - it will replace old value. If CSV have not existing tag - it will be added.
	All columns which starts from "@" are ignored.
	Special parameters used to pass names of the "id" and "type" columns. (type recognized as in osmconvert 0-node, 1-way, 2-relation)
	Another special column "update" may be used, to process only marked rows in CSV. Column may have any non empty value.

2 merging nodes with same coordinates
	--in and --out parameters must be specified. Only plain OSM files supported.
	All nodes except one with same coordinates will be marked to remove, and all tags merged into one node. Same values ignored, different values merged into same key with ";"
	currently exists bug with merging tags, where merging A, B and A values will not ignore second A and as result A;B;A will be produced, so please review data before you upload it.
	Resulting file will contain same items as input file, but with altered tags (if needed) and nodes marked to delete and to update. You can upload it using JOSM.
	*IMPORTANT NOTE*: tool will not alter any parent object like ways or relations which points to deleted nodes, thereby this mode is useful *only* for completely unconnected nodes.

*IMPORTANT NOTE*
Review resulting file and logs before you upload.
